<h1>Class Formulas and Vehicles Winter 2020/21</h1>
</div>

Welcome to the ECIU/TUHH class Formulas and Vehicles!

In this class we explore the exciting field of mobile robotics on the example of underwater robots.
During the class we will get in touch the whole robotics pipeline starting from sensing over perception to planning and control and actuation.
An important focus will lie on gaining hands-on robotics experience using a real underwater robots in experiments and simulations. Therefore, we offer access to our experimental facilities via a remote-labs and in person.

This shall motivate the students to learn about state-of-the-art robotic tools such as ROS/Gazebo and their usage for simulation and experiments.
Our class is based on the challenged based learning concept meaning that students explore the application and challenges in mobile robotics on their own in groups as part of guided assignments and a final project.

While the first half of the term will consist of keynote lectures and assignments the second half of the term is dedicated to final group projects.
In these projects the student groups identify interesting robotics problem of their own choice (e.g. pollution monitoring in harbors) and investigate the related theory and challenges. Finally, the groups will develop and propose solution concepts based on the topics covered.

Further Information coming soon!
