## Formulas and Vehicles - Introduction to Mobile Underwater Robotics
[Class Website](https://hippocampusrobotics.github.io/fav_docs/00_main_toc/overview.html#)

### General Information
In this class, we explore the exciting field of mobile robotics using the example of underwater robots. During the class we will get in touch with the whole robotics pipeline, starting from sensing over perception, to planning and control and actuation. An important focus will lie on gaining hands-on robotics experience during the assignments and the group project using real underwater robots in experiment and simulation. Therefore, we offer access to our experimental facilities.

This shall motivate the students to learn about state-of-the-art robotic tools such as ROS/Gazebo and their usage for simulation and experiments. Our class is based on the challenge-based-learning concept, meaning that students explore the application and challenges in mobile robotics on their own as part of guided assignments and a final group project.

While the first half of the term will consist of keynote lectures and assignments the second half of the term is dedicated to final group projects. In these projects the student groups identify interesting robotics problems of their own choice (e.g. pollution monitoring in harbors) and investigate the related theory and challenges. Finally, the groups will develop and propose solution concepts based on the topics covered.
