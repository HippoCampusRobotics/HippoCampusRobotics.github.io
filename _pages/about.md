<h1>Motivation</h1>
The world's oceans have been a crucial part for life on earth in the past and present, but will also determine our future. They include the least explored areas on earth due to the high cost and the risks involved in offshore and deep-sea activities. Recent technological advances in underwater robotics promise to open up groundbreaking possibilities in offshore areas, such as oceanographic research, offshore wind and deep sea mining. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are becoming increasingly important and will play a prominent role in the future. Today mostly single, highly specialized and very expensive vehicles are deployed. They usually have a low degree of autonomy and need a large vessel to be deployed. In order to optimize the use of these scarce resources, the next generation of autonomous underwater vehicles has to be able to evaluate mission performance and coordinate itself with other vehicles working on the same or similar task.

<h1>Project Description</h1>
We develop an AUV system with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation in the loop. This allows the modeling of realistic environmental dynamics by the simulation of the flow field and an estimation of sinks, sources (of heat, pollution, etc) and boundary conditions. Also, the results from the fluid dynamics simulation are fed back into the path planner for the AUVs. Depending on the mission objectives, regions with a high likelihood for sources can be of higher or lower interest as regions with a high field variable variance. Task allocation and consensus algorithms decide how the team of vehicles navigates within the field to satisfy both, robustness and a fast mission execution.
