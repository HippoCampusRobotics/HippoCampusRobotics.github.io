  <h1>About</h1>
The HippoCampus is a micro underwater robot for research applications.
The quad-rotor layout makes the robot extremely agile and suitable for hydrobatic maneuvers. 
HippoCampus is built with off-the-shelf components and 3D-printed parts.
It is developed for research in the area of autonomous exploration and monitoring.

  <h1>Vehicle Hardware</h1>
  The current underwater vehicle setup represents a very flexible and robust research platform. 
  We use a <a href="https://pixhawk.org/modules/pixhawk" target="_blank">Pixhawk</a> board with a 168 MHz Cortex M4F CPU (256 
  KB RAM, 2 MB Flash) and onboard sensors (3D ACC / Gyro / MAG / Baro). 
  PX4 is an independent, open-source, open-hardware project (BSD licensed) for mobile robotics applications. 
  The PX4 platform runs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NuttX" target="_blank">NuttX</a>, a small footprint real-time operating system (RTOS), which provides a POSIX-style environment. 
  Our HippoCampus control stack is a custom, BSD licensed underwater vehicle control stack, providing remote controlled and fully autonomous operations for our underwater vehicle hardware.
